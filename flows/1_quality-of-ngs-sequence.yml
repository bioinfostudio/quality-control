        choices:

        - ~CORRECT~ Yes
        - No 

        answer_explanation: Quality scores are dropping towards the end of the reads.

          # How can we trim the reads to filter out the low quality data?

        question: |

            By trimming off the bases after a fixed position of
            the read or by trimming off bases based on the [[blank1]] score.

        answer_explanation:

            Quality trimming discarded >25000 reads. However, we retain a lot of
            maximal length reads which have good quality all the way to the ends.
