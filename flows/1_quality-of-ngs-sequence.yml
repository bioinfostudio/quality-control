        choices:

        - ~CORRECT~ Yes
        - No 

        answer_explanation: Quality scores are dropping towards the end of the reads.

        choices:

          - ~CORRECT~ By trimming off the bases after a fixed position of the read
          - ~CORRECT~ By trimming off bases based on the quality score

        answer_explanation:

            Quality trimming discarded >25000 reads. However, we retain a lot of
            maximal length reads which have good quality all the way to the ends.
