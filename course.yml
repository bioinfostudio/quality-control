        # Quality Control 

        After completing this practical the trainee should be able to:

        - Assess the overall quality of NGS (FastQ format) sequence reads
        - Visualise the quality, and other associated matrices, of reads to decide on filters and cutoffs for cleaning up data ready for downstream analysis
        - Clean up adaptors and pre-process the sequence data for further analysis
