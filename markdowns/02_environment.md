To investigate sequence data quality we will demonstrate tools called
FastQC and Skewer. FastQC will process and present the reports in a
visual manner. Based on the results, the sequence data can be processed
using the Skewer. We will use one data set in this practical, which can
be found in the QC directory on your desktop.

Open the Terminal and go to the directory where the data are stored:

```bash
$ cd
$ ls
$ cd qc
$ pwd
```

At any time, help can be displayed for FastQC using the following
command:

```bash
$ fastqc -h
```

Look at SYNOPSIS (Usage) and options after typing `fastqc -h`
